# Commuter Alarm

*An alarm clock based on distance app using react native for Android (and iOS if there is time)*

**Step 1:** Clone this repo & cd into project

**Step 2:** Install node modules

```
npm install
```

**Step 3:** For testing, download Expo from the Playstore/Appstore

*Will need to let go of this method later on to access native android*

```
npm start
```

**Step 4:** Scan the QR code using the Expo app

That's all
